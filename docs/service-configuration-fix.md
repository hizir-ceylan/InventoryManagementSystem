# Windows Service Configuration Fix

## Problem Solved

Fixed the Windows service startup failure caused by configuration loading issues. The service was failing with:
```
Failed to load configuration from file 'C:\Program Files\Inventory Management System\Agent\appsettings.json'
```

## Solution

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Replaced Host.CreateDefaultBuilder() with Host.CreateApplicationBuilder()** 
   - Provides better control over configuration loading
   - Eliminates automatic configuration source conflicts
   - Uses `DisableDefaults = true` to prevent automatic appsettings.json loading

2. **Made appsettings.json completely optional**
   - Service starts successfully even if the file is missing
   - Configuration is loaded from environment variables as primary source
   - JSON file is only loaded if it exists and is valid

3. **Enhanced error handling and logging**
   - Improved service startup logging for better diagnostics
   - Fixed cleanup logic to prevent ObjectDisposedException
   - Added file logging for service mode debugging

4. **Simplified configuration approach**
   - Primary configuration through environment variables (ApiSettings.LoadFromEnvironment())
   - Minimal appsettings.json contains only logging configuration
   - Removed ApiSettings from JSON to prevent file dependency issues

### Environment Variables for Configuration:

The service can be configured entirely through environment variables:

```
ApiSettings__BaseUrl=http://localhost:5093
ApiSettings__EnableOfflineStorage=true
ApiSettings__OfflineStoragePath=C:\Program Files\Inventory Management System\Data\OfflineStorage
ApiSettings__Timeout=30
ApiSettings__RetryCount=3
ApiSettings__BatchUploadInterval=300
ApiSettings__MaxOfflineRecords=10000
```

### Testing

The fix has been tested to ensure:
- Service starts successfully without appsettings.json
- Service starts successfully with appsettings.json present
- Console mode continues to work normally
- Configuration is properly loaded from environment variables
- Error logging works in both console and service modes

### Deployment Notes

1. The updated build script creates a minimal appsettings.json with only logging configuration
2. Services installed using previous versions will continue to work
3. No changes needed to existing environment variable configurations
4. Service installation scripts remain unchanged
